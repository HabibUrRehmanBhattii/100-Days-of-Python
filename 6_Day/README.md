## 62. While Loops

[while loop](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Hurdle%202&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fhurdle2.json)

 While loops are used to repeat a block of code while a certain condition is true.

```python
# While loop
while condition:
    # Do something
```

OR 

```python
# While loop
while condition:
    # Do something
else:
    # Do something else
```

OR

```python
# While loop
while condition:
    # Do something
    if condition:
        break
else:
    # Do something else
```

OR

```python
# While loop
while condition:
    # Do something
    if condition:
        continue
else:
    # Do something else
```

OR

```python
# While loop
while condition:
    # Do something
    if condition:
        pass
else:
    # Do something else
```
**pass** here is a placeholder for future code.

OR

```python
# While loop
while condition:
    # Do something
    if condition:
        return
else:
    # Do something else
```
