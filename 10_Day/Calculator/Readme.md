# Calculator Python Project

## Introduction

This project is a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide. It will also keep a running total of the previous calculations.

## Instructions

1. Create a new file called `calculator.py`
2. Create a function called `add` that takes two parameters and returns the sum of those 2 numbers.
3. Create a function called `subtract` that takes two parameters and returns the difference of the 2 numbers.
4. Create a function called `multiply` that takes two parameters and returns the product.
5. Create a function called `divide` that takes two parameters and returns the quotient.
6. Create a function called `calculator` that takes three parameters. The first two parameters should be the first and second numbers for the operation. The third parameter should represent the operation to perform. This function should return the result of the operation.
7. Create a function called `main` that prints the result of the `calculator` function with the parameters 3, 4, and 'add'.
8. Run your `main` function.

## Hints

- You can use `input` to get user input. However, for this project, we suggest hard-coding the values for the numbers and the operation.
- You can use `print` to print the result of the `calculator` function.
- You can use `if` statements to determine which operation to perform.
- You can use `return` to return the result of the operation.
