# Day 7 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp

## Day 7: Hangman

### What I learned

* How to use the `random` module
* How to use the `split` method
* How to use the `join` method
* How to use the `choice` method
* How to use the `lower` method
* How to use the `replace` method
* How to use the `index` method
* How to use the `count` method
* How to use the `append` method
* How to use the `pop` method
* How to use the `clear` method
* How to use the `sort` method
* How to use the `os` method as a clear screen

### What I did

* I created a hangman game using the concepts I learned today.
* I used the `random` module to select a random word from a list of words.
* I used the `choice` method to select a random word from the list.
* I used the `lower` method to convert the user's guess to lowercase.

and so on...

### Challenges

* I had a hard time figuring out how to clear the screen. I used the `os` module to do this.
