# Don't use the sum() function to do the sum of the numbers in a list. You should use a for loop. and the len() function to get the length of the list.
# 1. Create a list of student heights.
# 2. Write a for loop to calculate the sum of all the heights in the list.
# 3. Write a for loop to calculate the total number of students in the list.
# 5. Calculate the average height using the sum of heights and the total number of students.
# 6. Print the average height rounded to the nearest whole number.
