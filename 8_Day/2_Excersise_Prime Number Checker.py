# # """ Here is the explanation for the code above:
# 1. We start by defining the function and giving it a parameter called number.
# 2. We create a variable called is_prime and set it to True.
# 3. We use a for loop and range function to check for factors. If there is a factor, the number is not prime and we change the is_prime variable to False.
# 4. Then we check if is_prime is True. If it is, we print "It's a prime number.". If not, we print "It's not a prime number.". """
