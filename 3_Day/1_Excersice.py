#  Here we are using the modulo operator to check if the number is even or odd. The modulo operator returns the remainder of the division of two numbers. For example, 5 % 2 = 1. So, 5 divided by 2 is 2 with a remainder of 1. So, 5 is an odd number. If the remainder is 0, the number is even. For example, 6 % 2 = 0. So, 6 divided by 2 is 3 with a remainder of 0. So, 6 is an even number.
