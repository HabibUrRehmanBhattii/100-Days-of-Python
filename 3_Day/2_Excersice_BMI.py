# Here we have used elif statements. The code checks if the bmi is less than or equal to 18.5. If it is,
# it prints "Your bmi is {bmi}, you are underweight". If it is not, it checks if the bmi is less than or equal to 25.
# If it is, it prints "Your bmi is {bmi}, you have a normal weight". If it is not, it checks if the bmi is less than
# or equal to 30. If it is, it prints "Your bmi is {bmi}, you have a slightly overweight". If it is not, it checks if
# the bmi is less than or equal to 35. If it is, it prints "Your bmi is {bmi}, you are obese". If it is not,
# it prints "Your bmi is {bmi}, you are clinically obese.".
